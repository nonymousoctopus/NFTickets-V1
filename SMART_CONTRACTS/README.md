# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

npm install

create env

npx hardhat compile

npx hardhat deploy --network fuji 

npx hardhat run scripts/Setup.js --network fuji

npx hardhat run scripts/CopyABIs.js 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat deploy --network fuji 

npx hardhat run scripts/Setup.js --network fuji

npx hardhat run scripts/CopyABIs.js 

```
